# Archived Fix Scripts

These files were archived on 2025-06-13 as part of the CodeFixer module integration.

## Description
These scripts were used for fixing various syntax and execution issues in PowerShell scripts. They have been replaced by the CodeFixer module's Invoke-AutoFix and related functions.

## Original Purpose
These files were originally used for standalone fixes and testing, but have been replaced by the consolidated functionality in the CodeFixer PowerShell module.

## Reference
For more information on the new approach, see:
- CodeFixer Guide(../docs/CODEFIXER-GUIDE.md)
- Testing Documentation(../docs/TESTING.md)
- Integration Summary(../INTEGRATION-SUMMARY.md)
