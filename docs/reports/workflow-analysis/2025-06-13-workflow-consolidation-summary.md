# Workflow Troubleshooting Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. YAML Syntax Errors
- **Fixed**: Removed duplicate filepath comments and backslashes in all workflow files:
 - `pester-macos.yml`
 - `pester-linux.yml` 
 - `pester-windows.yml`
 - `auto-test-generation-setup.yml`
 - `auto-test-generation-execution.yml`
 - `auto-test-generation-reporting.yml`

### 2. Escaped Quote Issues
- **Fixed**: Replaced all escaped quotes (`\'`) with proper single quotes (`'`) in:
 - PowerShell steps in `pester-macos.yml`
 - PowerShell steps in `pester-linux.yml`
 - PowerShell steps in `pester-windows.yml`

### 3. Cache Key References
- **Fixed**: Updated invalid cache key references from non-existent file to valid file:
 - Changed from `\.github/actions/lint/requirements.txt` 
 - Changed to `tests/PesterConfiguration.psd1`

### 4. PowerShell Script Issues
- **Fixed**: Corrected `0201_Install-NodeCore.ps1` script structure:
 - Moved `Param(object$Config)` block to the top of the script
 - Ensured proper script-level parameter handling

### 5. Pester Installation Consistency
- **Fixed**: Standardized Pester installation across all workflows:
 - Added consistent error handling
 - Used specific version (5.7.1) for reproducibility
 - Added proper try-catch blocks

### 6. Missing Dependencies
- **Fixed**: Added verification steps for test helpers and required directories
- **Created**: Local test validation script (`scripts/test-workflow-locally.ps1`)

## Validation Results

PASS **All workflow files now have valid YAML syntax**
PASS **All PowerShell scripts can be loaded without errors** 
PASS **Pester configuration loads successfully**
PASS **Test helpers load and function correctly**
PASS **Required directories exist**

## Next Steps

1. **Re-run workflows** to verify fixes resolve the issues
2. **Monitor workflow status** using the dashboard in README.md
3. **Address any remaining runtime issues** that may surface during execution

## Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/pester-macos.yml`
- `.github/workflows/pester-linux.yml`
- `.github/workflows/pester-windows.yml`
- `.github/workflows/auto-test-generation-setup.yml`
- `.github/workflows/auto-test-generation-execution.yml`
- `.github/workflows/auto-test-generation-reporting.yml`
- `pwsh/runner_scripts/0201_Install-NodeCore.ps1`
- `README.md` (added workflow dashboard)

## Test Scripts Created

- `scripts/test-workflow-locally.ps1` - Local workflow component testing
- `scripts/validate-workflow-health.sh` - Comprehensive health validation

The workflows should now pass successfully. If any issues remain, they are likely runtime-specific and will need to be addressed based on the actual execution logs from GitHub Actions.
