- Implement test result reporting and analysis
- Configure code coverage collection and reporting
- Set up performance benchmarking and regression testing
- Implement integration and end-to-end testing

### Quality Gates
- Configure PSScriptAnalyzer for static code analysis
- Set up security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- Implement dependency vulnerability scanning
- Configure code quality metrics and thresholds
- Set up documentation generation and validation
- Implement compliance and policy checking

### Deployment Automation
- Configure automated deployment pipelines
- Set up environment-specific configurations
- Implement blue-green or rolling deployment strategies
- Configure infrastructure as code deployment
- Set up automated rollback procedures
- Implement deployment health checks and monitoring

### Release Management
